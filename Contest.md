`The project is not currently public as the repo still contains private information i need to scrub`

When i found out that literally every card version and match was recorded and available to view (i hope they dont remove it). End game was to be able to search up someones username, see the matches and replay whichever whenever.

The current result is a barely functional match processor that can display cards. But i believe it has potential
