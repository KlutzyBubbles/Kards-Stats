# Kards Stats

the idea was heavily influenced by HSReplay (as a previous hearthstone player and a lover of HSReplay i wanted something similar for kards).

# What this wiki is

This wiki is an overview of all projects relating to gathering statistics for kards, this was triggered by a recent blocker that demotivated me to continue.

I am hoping that showcasing these ideas can get me unbanned to continue or motivate someone else to continue.
