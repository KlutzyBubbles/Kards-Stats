## tldr

After not touching the game for over a month, i have been banned for what i can only assume are my projects relating to kards and every message i have sent over the past 6 months hasnt been answered and just ignored.

It feels like i have been severed from the game with no warning and no explination.

Please someone help get the message through

# What is the 'project'

I good example of one main branch of the project is the website, which was triggered after i saw someone on the discord asking for people to submit match details to see what decks were getting matched against others.

The other main branch of the project would be Contest, a replay viewer for matches

# What is this

Contacting 1939 games is a painful process that only succeeded for me once, and that was when i revealed a potential privacy issue that could cause them trouble.

I want people who play the game, mods (maybe other people from 1939 Games) to see this to get a feel of whether or not i am interpreting all of this correctly and whether or not it is justified. (and for some closure because i cant stop thinking about it)


# Why the ban matters so much

Its less about the ban more about the time i have put into both the game and the POC's surrounding the game along with the lack of communication and just ignoring every attempt at contacting

# Timeline

Go back 6 months (March 2021) when i first contacted about my project.

Keep in mind this is `solved` but i still havent received a response.

The basic idea was replicate the requests made by the game in a seperate program (at a much slower rate, only once after a game instead of throughout the match).

With this being unanswered i decided to continue using an alternate account. Which worked fine for a month or two, which produced a nice first set of data https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KqoAlzKpgsrtrVjs5F49laajjKTxcYsQRx52O2kRqP0/edit?usp=sharing

Fast forward 2 months (June 2021) and i create https://github.com/KlutzyBubbles/kards-discord-bot. After posting it on reddit i was told to contact about the legality of it. So i did (low key surprised it still works and has auto updated with the new cards released)

Still no response. Fast forward 3 months (September 2021), the new update is released and i log in to see the new cards and try them out (I had not logged into my main account for over 1 month). I am now banned. I immediately contact support

3 days after i dont want it to turn into another 6 month `solved` case, so i use discord, to be clear the mods are AWESOME, instant replies, good information, but as soon as i reach someone at 1939 Games to contact it goes silent

I decided to be patient once more and said i will give them 2 weeks, 2 weeks before i make this literal cry for help.

## Banned reason

To be clear i

- Never used my main account for this project
- Never queued for a match using the alt accounts unless i logged in and played the match like i usually would
- Never used the data to cheat in an online game (i had to know if it were possible in a private match that was planned)
- Never shared any of the personal information i found before it was patched
- Never intentionally attacked or tried to comprimise the game in any way
- Never trolled in matches

I believe i was banned just from (the admittedly correct) association to the accounts i used either by IP or by computer information. While i am the same person, i never received any information, warning or requests to stop what i am doing.

# Why are you reading this

I know only a few may actually take the time to read this, i thank you. I am hoping that someone will be able to share this with someone who can (share with another person who can) actually let someone at 1939 Games know of the situation so i can get some form of closure.

I have gotten very attached to this project and the game, so this is why i have spent so long creating appeals for what happened.
