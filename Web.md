# DT Web

This is the most finished of all the ideas, although with all my accounts banned i had to improvise data for the screenshots.

Also i am by no means a front end developer, this is mostly to make it look as pretty as i can make it to show the potential.

## Most played cards

For about 2 weeks the testing was going great and i was able to monitor the most played cards (at the time it was bloody sickle can you believe).

This was going to be te first step before trying to figure out what cards are most played when and whether they result in wins etc.

## Wins by nation

Another one that worked well, for 2 weeks i was able to see the winning combinations, which were surprisingly balanced.
